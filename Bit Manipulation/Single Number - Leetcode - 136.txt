136 - Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]

Output: 1

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.


Solution in CPP:

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = 0;
        for(int num : nums)
        {
            n^=num;
        }
        return n;
    }
};


Explanation:

First we are taking n = 0 which we are going to return 
then using loop visiting all the numbers in the array 

doing xor operation with each number in the array with n and storing it in n itself continuously for every numbers at last we will the get the number that appears only once in the array


Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]

n = 0;
n = 0^2 => 0000
           0010 
      ^ => 0010 => n = 2

n = 2
n = 2^2 => 0010
           0010
      ^ => 0000 => n = 0

n = 0
n = 0^1 => 0000
           0001
      ^ => 0001 => n = 1

So 1 is the answer 

this is how it works
