137 - Single Number II

Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.


Solution in CPP :

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<=31;i++)
        {
            int c = 0;
            for(int n : nums)
            {
                if(n&(1<<i))
                {
                    c++;
                }
            }
            if(c%3==1)
            {
                ans|=(1<<i);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

Explanation : 

First setting ans = 0 
Then running a loop from 0 to 31 as it is given in the constraint
then setting c(count) variable to 0

then running a loop for traversing the array values and checking a condition(n & (1<<i) != 0) whether the bit of each number has set bits then increment c 
after coming out of the inner loop check whether c % 3 == 1 if yes then make the ans variable ith bit that is the index of current iteration into a set bit by using this line 
ans = (ans | (1<<i))

Then repeat it again for all 0 to 31 bitindices

at last return ans that will be the answer

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]

ans = 0, c = 0, i = 0
 1) i = 0 => 2 & (1<<0) = 2 & 1 = 0
             2 & (1<<0) = 2 & 1 = 0
             3 & (1<<0) = 3 & 1 = 1 => c = 1
             2 & (1<<0) = 2 & 1 = 0

        c % 3 => 1 % 3 = 1 so,
        
        ans = ans | (1<<i) => 0 | (1<<0) => 0 | 1 = 1
        ans = 1

ans = 1, c = 0, i = 1
 2) i = 1 => 2 & (1<<1) = 2 & 2 = 2 => c = 1
             2 & (1<<1) = 2 & 2 = 2 => c = 2
             3 & (1<<1) = 3 & 2 = 2 => c = 3
             2 & (1<<1) = 2 & 2 = 2 => c = 4

        c % 3 => 4 % 3 = 1 so,

        ans = ans | (1<<i) => 1 | (1<<1) => 1 | 2 = 3
        ans = 3

        The answer is 3.

hereafter no changes happens but still it runs fully that is upto 31

This is happening because

2 -> 0 1 0
2 -> 0 1 0
3 -> 0 1 1
2 -> 0 1 0

Here 0th position has 1 set bit , as they gave that there will three pairs of numbers will be there we can mod the total number of set bits at ith position by 3
if it is 1 means (2 is not possible ) only 0 and 1 is possible because either the total no of bits will come under 3rd table as it has 3 pairs else it will be 1 if we mod by 3 because only one number is alone no pair of numbers

so here in 0th position only 1 bit so 1 in 0th position is added 
in 1th position 4 set bits 4%3 = 1 so 1 bit in 1th position 

goes on...

atlast if we convert it into base 10 then it will be 

1 bit each in 0th and 1th positions
so it is 3..
